![](Logo_airlines.jpg)

In this notebook, I analyzed the U.S. Commercial Aviation Industry Data. This dataset was made available by the U.S. Department of Transportation's TranStats service makes available on various metrics for 15 U.S. airlines and 30 major U.S airports. Their website unfortunately does not include a method for easily downloading and sharing files. I downloaded this dataset from Kaggle.

Following tasks were performed:

- Network map was created for 3 major airports, that are: Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Los Angeles International Airport, Chicago O'Hare International Airport
- Heatmap was created to understand the variation of flights over the years for different Airports and Airlines
- Multi panel plot was created to understand the variation of Domestic and International flights (Percentages) over the years at different airports
- Explored the 2014 Year in detail to understand the busiest Airports in terms of Domestic and International Flights.
- Made a radar map to understand the count of domestic/international flights and total of number of passengers that travelled through those airlines in 2014.
